## Find a Scorpion

### Problem Description

A scorpion on n vertices is a graph that has a vertex of degree 1 (the tail), connected to a vertex of degree
2 (the body), connected to a vertex of degree n-2 (the head). The other n-3 vertices (the feet) can be
arbitrarily interconnected.

Give an O(n) algorithm for deciding whether or not an arbitrary graph is a scorpion, assuming that the
graph is represented by an adjacency matrix.
